Suppose we have the universal set, $\{x_1,\ldots,x_k\}$, where the first element $x_1$ is $\varnothing$. From inspection, it is clear that \underline{Hatsune Miku} is cuter than $\varnothing$. Suppose for some natural number $j$, we know that \underline{Hatsune Miku} is cuter than $x_j$. If \underline{Hatsune Miku} is cuter than an object, she must surely be cuter than the successor object as well. Thus by the principles of mathematical induction, we have proved that for every $j$, \underline{Hatsune Miku} is cuter than $x_j$. Hence, \underline{Hatsune Miku} is the cutest in the world.
